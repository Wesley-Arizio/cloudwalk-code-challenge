# Code challenge

### Running the project

This is a rust script designed to generate reports based on logs of a game [log link here](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/be1b636e58abff14088c8b5309f575d8).

To run the project you must have Rust installed in your machine, follow this [tutorial setup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After you have installed everything, run the following command in your terminal. 

```bash
cargo run
```

As the script ran successfully, you'll see a new file called output.json, that is a report of the game matches  extracted from the log file.

### Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests run the following

```bash
cargo test
```
